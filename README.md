**BFS**, **DFS**, **Dijkstra** and **A*** algorithms has been implemented using Python 3. These are the basic algorithms for discrete planning, which also share a lot of similarities.

Files included:

- **search.py** is the file where you the algorithms has been implemented.
- **main.py** is the scrip that provides helper functions that load the map from csv files and visualize the map and path. 
- **map.csv** is the map file that creates your own map.
- **test_map.csv** restores a test map for doc test purpose only.

## Instruction

`python search.py`

When running **search.py** as a main function, it will run a doc test for all the algorithms. It loads **test_map.csv** as the map for testing.

---

For visualization, please run:

`python main.py`

There should be 4 maps shown representing the results of 4 algorithms.
